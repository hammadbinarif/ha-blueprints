## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up in your Home Assistant:

1.  **Google Generative AI Conversation Integration:**
    * Install and configure the `Google Generative AI Conversation` integration in Home Assistant. This is required for the AI analysis feature of the blueprint.
    * You will need to obtain an API key for Google Gemini.

2.  **`jq` (JSON processor):**
    * The `update_doorbell_events.sh` script relies on `jq` for JSON manipulation.
    * You need to install `jq` on your Home Assistant server's operating system.
        * **Home Assistant OS/Supervised (via SSH Add-on):**
            ```bash
            apk add jq # For Alpine Linux based OS (HA OS, Supervised)
            ```
        * **Home Assistant Container (Docker):** You might need to build a custom container image that includes `jq`, or execute `apk add jq` inside the container if you have shell access.
        * **Home Assistant Core (on Debian/Ubuntu):**
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install jq
            ```

## üì¶ Installation

This repository contains:
* Three **Blueprints** (for doorbell snapshot/AI analysis and notifications and for old photos cleanup).
* **Shell Scripts** (for updating the JSON and managing directories).

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Manual Setup for Shell Scripts and Directories (REQUIRED!)

The blueprints and automation rely on specific shell commands and directories. These **MUST be set up manually** on your Home Assistant server.

1.  **Create Script and Data Directories:**
    Connect to your Home Assistant server via SSH (e.g., using the SSH & Web Terminal add-on) and run these commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /config/scripts/
    mkdir -p /config/www/camera_snapshots/
    mkdir -p /config/www/doorbell/
    ```

2.  **Download Shell Script:**
    Download the `update_doorbell_events.sh` script from this repository:
    * [Download `update_doorbell_events.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hammadbinarif/ha-blueprints/main/scripts/update_doorbell_events.sh) (Right-click and "Save Link As..." or copy raw content)
    Place this downloaded file into the `/config/scripts/` directory you created.

3.  **Make Script Executable:**
    In your SSH terminal, make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x /config/scripts/update_doorbell_events.sh
    ```

4.  **Configure `shell_command`s in `configuration.yaml`:**
    Add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file. If you already have a `shell_command:` section, just add the entries under it.

    ```yaml
    # configuration.yaml
    shell_command:
      # Command to delete snapshots older than 30 days
      clean_camera_snapshots: "find /config/www/camera_snapshots/ -type f -mtime +30 -delete"
      # Command to create the camera snapshots directory (blueprint uses this)
      create_camera_snapshots_dir: "mkdir -p /config/www/camera_snapshots"
      # Command to create the doorbell JSON directory
      create_doorbell_dir: "mkdir -p /config/www/doorbell"
      # Command to update the doorbell events JSON file
      update_doorbell_events_json: >
        /config/scripts/update_doorbell_events.sh "{{ img_path_for_card }}" "{{ description_clean }}" "{{ timestamp_iso }}" "{{ max_items_to_store | default(100) }}"
    ```

5.  **Restart Home Assistant:**
    Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Restart Home Assistant** to apply the `configuration.yaml` changes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Installation for Home Assistant Blueprints (Recommended)

## ü§ù Integration with Photo Carousel Card

This blueprint and the generated `doorbell_events.json` file work perfectly with the **Photo Carousel Card**. You can install the card via HACS from:

* **[Photo Carousel Card GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hammadbinarif/photo-carousel-card)**

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?repository=photo-carousel-card&category=plugin&owner=hammadbinarif)

Once installed, configure the Photo Carousel Card to use your generated JSON file:

```yaml
type: custom:photo-carousel-card
title: Doorbell Events
description_file_path: /local/doorbell/doorbell_events.json # This path maps to /config/www/doorbell/doorbell_events.json
autoplay: 10000
reload_interval_minutes: 1
max_items_to_show: 15
max_days_to_show: 7 # Filter photos based on the timestamp generated by the blueprint
# Add any other styling options as desired
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

* **Automation fails with "No access to path" error:**
    * Ensure `/config/www/camera_snapshots` (and any other custom paths used) are explicitly listed under `homeassistant: allowlist_external_dirs:` in your `configuration.yaml`.
    * Restart Home Assistant after modifying `configuration.yaml`.
    * Verify the `camera.snapshot` service call in the automation trace to see the exact path it's trying to write to.
* **`update_doorbell_events.sh` script fails:**
    * Ensure `jq` is installed on your Home Assistant server.
    * Verify the script path in `shell_command.update_doorbell_events_json` is correct (`/config/scripts/update_doorbell_events.sh`).
    * Check script permissions: `chmod +x /config/scripts/update_doorbell_events.sh`.
    * Look for errors in your Home Assistant logs (**Settings** > **System** > **Logs**) related to `shell_command` or the script's output.
